#Define two variables and print them
a = 6
c = 3.14
print(a, c)

#Define two variables and print them using concatenation

#Which of the following are operators, and which are values?
operators ("-, /, +, *")
values  ('hello', -88.8, 5)

#What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
'expresssions are made up of a combination of values and operators and expressions return a value."

#This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10 . What is
#the difference between an expression and a statement?

"an expression returns a value while a statement does not"

#What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?
#    bacon = 20
#    bacon + 1

bacon = 21

#Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
"this is because variable names don't begin with a number!"

#What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point
#number, or string version of a value?
int() to get integer value
str() to get string value
float() to get floats value

#Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
# 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
'because we are try to join a string value and an interger value. that gives the error'
"the solution is to convert the integer value to string first."
'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
